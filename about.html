<h1><i>About Me</i></h1>
<p>Hello, and thanks for stopping by! My name's Lisa, and I'm a librarian (fun fact: the primary database for library science research is Library & Information Science Abstracts—LISA! I was literally born for this career). Originally from Menaquesk (Saint John, New Brunswick), I've also lived in Fredericton, NB and am now based in Tiohtià:ke/Mooniyang (Montreal, QC). My academic background is in English literature, in which I hold a BA (Honours)  and an MA. From 2015-2021, I pursued a doctorate in McGill's Department of English, before deciding to pursue a career in librarianship. In my work as a humanities scholar, I was interested in how modernist women think about illness, aging, and dying in their late works; I presented on just these topics at national and international conferences. I've also published academic articles and book reviews to help contribute to a vibrant academic community.</p>
<p>I bring this approach to my daily experience training as an information professional, and in the library itself. My approach is grounded in compassion, collaboration, intellectual honesty, and lifelong learning.</p>

<h1><i>Why "stay curious"?</i></h1>
<p>If you've spent time on this website, chances are you've noticed the tagline "stay curious." Library work is rooted in discovery and in access--in my professional practice and philosophy, each of these require curiosity. Curiosity has been a driver for my own work--whether as a humanities scholar untangling difficult modernist poetry, or now as a librarian helping a patron with whatever they bring to the desk. I hope that you, too, will embrace curiosity and stay curious.</p>
